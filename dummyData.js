This new text combines clear narratives of how the immune system functions relying in many instances on supporting data from experiments. The editors use examples and illustrations depicting basic immunologic processes in conjunction with their role in infectious or other diseases in order to teach both basic and applied aspects of immunology. Ideally suited for upper division and graduate level students as well as medical and dental students with a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology, the text complements traditional views and dogmas about immunology with today's cutting edge ideas and experimental data describing how the immune system works.",

In both cases, the utilization of bioreactors capable of providing biomimetic culture environments is instrumental for supporting cell differentiation and functional assembly. In the present study, neonatal rat heart cells were cultured on highly porous collagen scaffolds in bioreactors with electrical field stimulation. A hallmark of excitable tissues such as myocardium is the ability to propagate electrical impulses. We utilized the method of optical mapping to measure the electrical impulse propagation. The average conduction velocity recorded for the stimulated constructs (14.4 +/- 4.1 cm/s) was significantly higher than that of the nonstimulated constructs (8.6 +/- 2.3 cm/s, p = 0.003). The measured electrical propagation properties correlated to the contractile behavior and the compositions of tissue constructs. Electrical stimulation during culture significantly improved amplitude of contractions, tissue morphology, and connexin-43 expression compared to the nonsimulated controls. These data provide evidence that electrical stimulation during bioreactor cultivation can improve electrical signal propagation in engineered cardiac constructs.",
